# [Count Primes](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/102/math/744/)
Given an integer `n`, return *the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than* `n`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 0
```

#### Constraints:
- `0 <= n <= 5 * 10^6`

#### Hint #1
Checking all the integers in the range `[1, n-1]` is not efficient. Think about a better approach.

#### Hint #2
Since most of the numbers are not primes, we need a fast approach to exclude the non-prime integers.

#### Hint #3
Use Sieve of Eratosthenes.
