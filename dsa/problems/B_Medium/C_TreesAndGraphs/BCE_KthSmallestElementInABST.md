# [Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-medium/108/trees-and-graphs/790/)
Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return *the* `kth` *smallest value (**1-indexed**) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.*  

#### Example 1:
<img src="images/BCE_example1.jpg" width="210" height="270">

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1
```

#### Example 2:
<img src="images/BCE_example2.jpg" width="300" height="300">

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
```

#### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

#### Follow up:
If the BST is modified often (i.e. we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?

##### Hint 1:
Try to utilize the property of a BST.

##### Hint 2:
Try in-order traversal.

##### Hint 3:
What if you could modify the BST node's structure?

##### Hint 4:
The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).
