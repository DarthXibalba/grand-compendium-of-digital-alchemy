# [Word Search II](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-hard/119/backtracking/853/)

Given an `m x n` `board` of characters and a list of strings `words`, return *all words on the board*.

Each word must be construcdted from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where **adjacent cells** are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

#### Example 1:
<img src="images/CDB_search1.jpg">

```
Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["eat","oath"]
```

#### Example 2:
<img src="images/CDB_search2.jpg">

```
Input: board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]
Output: []
```

#### Constraints:
- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 12`
- `board[i][j]` is a lowercase English letter.
- `1 <= words.length <= 3 * 10⁴`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of `words` are unique.

<summary><b>Hint #1</b></summary>
You would need to optimize your backtracking to pass the larger test. Could you stop backtracking earlier?

<summary><b>Hint #2</b></summary>

If the current candidate does not exist in all words' prefix, you could stop backtracking immediately. What kind of data structure could answer such query efficiently? Does a hash table work? Why or why not? How about a Trie? If you would like to learn how to implement a basic trie, please work on this problem: [Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/) first.
